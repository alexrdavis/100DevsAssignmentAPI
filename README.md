## How to use
Enter class number into the input field to get a list of assignments for that class - assignments will be seperated into "watch", "read", "do", and "push"
If an assignment is repeated, this means it was assigned for both classes

To get a specific task grouping, you can add "/task" to the field. Example: "19/do"
